# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to Programming with Data Structures! In the following modules, we'll be covering three topics:

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked.md)
- [Trees](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain explanations, descriptions, and examples of the data structure in question.  At the end of each module, there will be a problem for you to solve. A solution will be provided, but you should only look at it after completing the problem yourself.
